# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from structured data. The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, identifying anomalies, and supporting data-driven decision-making.


# Workflow
**1. Database Exploration:** Exploring all the objects in the database to get an indepth understanding of the data.
**2. Dimension Exploration:** Identifying unique values or categories in each dimensions. It helps to recognize how the data might be grouped or segmented.
**3. Date Exploration:** Identifying the earliest and latest dates to get a clear understanding about the time span of the data.
**4. Measure Exploration:** Calculate the key metrics of the business and generate a report that shows all the metrics.
**5. Magnitude Analysis:** Comparing the values of the measures by categories. It helps us understand the importance of different categories in the dataset.
**6. Ranking Analysis:** Ordering the value of dimension by measure to find the top and the bottom performers in the given dataset.
