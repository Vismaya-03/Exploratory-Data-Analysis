# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from structured data. The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, identifying anomalies, and supporting data-driven decision-making.


##  Analysis Workflow

1. **Database Exploration**  
   Exploring all the objects in the database to get an in-depth understanding of the data.

2. **Dimension Exploration**  
   Identifying unique values or categories in each dimension to understand how the data can be grouped or segmented.

3. **Date Exploration**  
   Identifying the earliest and latest dates to understand the overall time span of the data.

4. **Measure Exploration**  
   Calculating key business metrics and generating a report that summarizes all metrics.

5. **Magnitude Analysis**  
   Comparing measure values across categories to understand the importance of different categories in the dataset.

6. **Ranking Analysis**  
   Ordering dimension values by measures to identify top and bottom performers in the dataset.
